			Hi, my name is <strong>Brad Jones</strong> and I'm excited to be taking CSC111 (<em>Computers for Math and Science</em>) at North Seattle College. When I'm not attending classes I am usually bartending at <a href="www.theoctopusbar.com">The Octopus Bar</a> in Wallingford. I have a culinary degree and over 15 years experience in the hospitality industry.

			I'm currently enrolled in the Programming and IT Networking Support AAS-T program, and planning to apply for the Application Dev BAS. Computers and technology have always been a big part of my life, from building my first computer to play quake II, to setting up my own custom home media centers. Ultimatly I'd like to completly redesign bar and restuarant POS systems using cloud hosted web apps that manage POS, Bookkeeping, Payroll, and Inverntory in a central management system that uses machine learning to predict trends, maximize sales, and automate administrative tasks. I happy taking things one class at a time for now though!
